# Introduction_Data_Visualization_with_Seaborn
In this project we will learn the basics of Data visualization using Seaborn, an inbuilt library in python for data visualization.ha
Data Visualization using python has been handy for representing information extracted from complex or large datasets.
Matplotlib is the fundamental library which is used for plotting graphs but there are scenarios where the code length extends an accepted limit.
To counter this, we are using Seaborn which helps in minimizing the code.
Here, our main focus we will be using in-built functions of Seaborn along with Matplotlib and Pandas.
The dataset which is used for visualization purposes is Pokemon dataset available for free at Kaggle.
